Along with their primary purpose of supporting the short-term weather prediction and disaster response communities, they also have numerous socioeconomic uses, such as analyzing changes in population density using nighttime lights or spotting power outages in the absence of lights in known urban areas. A number of sources contribute to the DNB signal, including city lights, lightning, fishing fleet navigation lights, gas flares, lava flows, and even auroras.\n",
