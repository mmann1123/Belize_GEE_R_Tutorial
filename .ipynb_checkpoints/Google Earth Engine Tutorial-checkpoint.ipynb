    "Variables are simply storage containers like a Tupperware container with a name on it. You can use a variable to store anything: numbers, rasters, data collections, shapefiles etc. \n",

    "\n",
    "``` print(annual_income) ```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` 8,008 ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using variables\n",
    "In this case we might want to store the minimum and median sentinel-2 data for 2017. Let's create two variables by inserting the following into your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` var median_image = dataset.median() ```\n",

    "Ok first let's import a shapefile of Belize and add it to the map. Please all the following to the bottom of your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` // Get the boundary of Belize from Google's Fusion Table ``` <br>\n",
    "``` // Change Country name for different location ```<br>\n",
    "``` var country_boundary = ee.FeatureCollection('USDOS/LSIB/2013') ```<br>\n",
